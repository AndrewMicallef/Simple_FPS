#Simple_FPS 

This started off just as an exercise in the blender game engine.
There is no clear outcome, however there are a few things I would like to implement.

[ ] Mechanically realistic weapon, in the style of [Receiver](http://www.wolfire.com/receiver)

[ ] Artificial life simulation:
	Either,
	- Artificial Neural network controlled NPC
	- Genetically evolving NPCs
	- or both
